# VR_RainbowMath
Visual and spatial math based puzzle game.
The dream is for this to be a successful educational tool, giving students a more tangible and intuitive relationship with numbers. Preliminary testing with 5th graders showed they were able to solve 6th grade negative numbers tests after just a 40 minute session! I'm also excited to partner with some friends and add more art, visual and auditory, to the game to celebrate the beauty of numbers.
